## Summary for Acting like we make $1000/hr:
 valuing your time can highly lead to greater productivity and success. many people undervalue their time, which leads to wasting it on unproductive activities and giving it away to others who do not deserve it. so we need to focus on activities that will help us achieve our goals. Business stress sometimes can lead to real problems and have negative effects on our productivity therefore we need to focus on our most important tasks and value our time more.

 ## How to think like a programmer:

You can think and solve problems like a programmer by following these steps:

1. First you need to understand the problem and make sure you know what is being asked. 

2. plan your solution and write down the exact steps needed to solve the problem. Don't start coding right away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. Divide and conquer: Break the problem into simpler problems and start working on each one and solving them all will result in solving the main problem

4. If you get stuck on something, reduce the problem to something simpler until you know how to solve it. Then, expand the problem slightly and keep going until you can solve the original problem.

## Solving Problems

To solve programming problems, follow these steps:

Read the problem completely twice to make sure you understand it. Read any examples provided.

Solve the problem manually with at least three sets of sample data. Write down each step and why you're doing it.

Optimize the manual steps. Try to simplify or reduce steps where possible.

Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

Optimize the real code.

we need to optimize the solution and look for ways to simplify it. This step can save us a lot of time and effort in the long run.

## The 5 Whys:

The "5 Whys" is a problem-solving technique used to identify the root cause of a problem by asking "why" five times. It was developed by Taiichi Ohno, a Japanese engineer and businessman, as part of the Toyota Production System. The process involves asking "why" repeatedly, with each answer leading to a subsequent "why" until the underlying cause of the problem is revealed.

## The Super Mario Effect:

The videos idea is that people are more likely to succeed when they focus on the goal itself, rather than the obstacles in their way. In other words, if we approach a task with a mindset of fun and curiosity, we are more likely to persist in the face of failure. The Super Mario Effect suggests that by shifting our focus from the obstacles to the goal, we can achieve success and reach our desired outcome.
