#### Q1. What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

React Context is a feature in React that allows you to manage state and share data between components without the need to pass props through multiple levels of the component tree. It consists of a Provider that supplies the shared data and a Consumer (or the useContext hook) to access that data. React Context is advantageous for avoiding prop drilling, creating global state, enhancing code maintainability, and optimizing performance. It simplifies the process of managing state and data sharing, enabling components at various levels of the hierarchy to interact with shared data efficiently.

#### Q2. Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.

The useContext hook is a feature in React that simplifies the process of accessing data from a React Context within a functional component. It allows you to directly access context data without the need for a Consumer component or render prop pattern.

Key Points:

useContext is used to consume data from a React Context in functional components.
It eliminates prop drilling by providing direct access to context data.
Context data is provided through the Provider component and accessed using the useContext hook.
useContext enhances code readability and maintainability by reducing the need for intermediary components.
The hook efficiently manages re-renders, updating components only when context data changes.
It works well with other hooks, promoting component composition and reusability.

#### Q3. Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.

Next.js is a React framework designed to simplify web application development by offering server-rendering, static site generation, routing, and more. It aims to improve performance, developer experience, and SEO while accommodating various rendering methods. An example from the Vercel Next.js Examples repository, such as the "Auth0" example, demonstrates how Next.js can be used to build scalable web applications. This example focuses on integrating Auth0 for user authentication and showcases Next.js's capability to handle complex tasks while maintaining security, user experience, and performance optimization. The Vercel Next.js Examples repository provides valuable resources for learning how to leverage Next.js for different application scenarios.
