# Modules and Testing

## Q1 What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

+ Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development technique, in this technique the tests are prepared before the code is even written ,an example of it's benifits is getting better documentation, better debugging ,implementing better designs and wider coverage of testing.
this is possible by following specific steps.

## Q2 Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?

+ It's done to seperate the pieces of code taht are imported from modules in different scripts, therefore it makes the app dynamic and fllexible, and easy to test

## Q3 Describe the concept of recursion in Python.
+ Python has a recursion call limit, which limits the number of times a function can be called by itself, in addition to taht Python has unique features that makes it easier to write recursion functions for specific problems.

## Q4 What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.

+ A module is a file that contains Python code, such as functions, classes, and variables, that can be imported and used in other Python programs. and are typically used to organize related code into a single file that can be easily shared and reused.

+ A package, on the other hand, is a directory that contains one or more Python modules and an additional, and are typically used to organize related modules into a hierarchy, and to prevent naming conflicts between modules with the same name.
