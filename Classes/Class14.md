## Q1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

Matplotlib:

+ Versatile, low-level plotting library.
+ Provides fine-grained control and customization.
+ Suitable for creating basic and complex static visualizations.

Seaborn:

+ Higher-level library built on Matplotlib.
+ Offers aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
+ Ideal for exploring statistical relationships and handling categorical data.

Bokeh:

+ Designed for interactive visualization.
+ Supports web-based, interactive plots.
+ Well-suited for creating dashboards and exploring large datasets.

## Q2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

Seaborn provides several main functions for creating different types of plots:

Relational Plots:

+ scatterplot(): Displays the relationship between two continuous variables using dots.
+ lineplot(): Plots the relationship between two continuous variables using lines.

Categorical Plots:

+ barplot(): Represents the relationship between a categorical variable and a continuous variable using bars.
+ countplot(): Shows the count of observations in each category of a categorical variable using bars.

Distribution Plots:

+ histplot(): Creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable.
+ kdeplot(): Plots the kernel density estimate of a continuous variable, providing a smooth distribution representation.
+ boxplot(): Displays the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories using quartiles and outliers.

## Q3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

+ The Seaborn Cheat Sheet plays a crucial role in a Python developer's workflow when working with the Seaborn library. It provides a handy reference for quickly accessing Seaborn functionalities and features. Key sections and elements featured in the cheat sheet include plotting functions categorized by plot type, figure aesthetics for customizing the visual appearance of plots, categorical data plotting functions, statistical estimation functions, matrix plot functions, and axes-level functions. By using the cheat sheet, developers can efficiently explore and utilize Seaborn's capabilities, saving time and streamlining their data visualization workflow.
