## Singly Linked Lists

A singly linked list is a data structure that stores a collection of data where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. It is like a train where each carriage represents a node and the links between them represent the connections or pointers. Unlike arrays, singly linked lists can be dynamically resized, but can be slower when it comes to searching and accessing elements. Singly linked lists are useful when we need to store and manipulate a collection of data that needs to be easily modified. To create a singly linked list, we first create a node with the desired value and a reference to the next node, and then add or remove nodes by changing the references. An example of creating a singly linked list with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 is given.
