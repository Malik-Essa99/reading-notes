### Q1. How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?

Django Forms in the Django web framework facilitate the handling of user input by providing a convenient way to define and validate HTML forms on the server side. The key components of creating a form using Django are as follows:

+ Importing Dependencies: Import the necessary modules from the Django library.

+ Defining a Form Class: Create a subclass of django.forms.Form to define the form's fields and their validation rules.

+ Rendering the Form in a View: Instantiate the form class in a view and pass it to the template context.

+ Template Rendering: Create an HTML template and render the form fields using Django's template engine.

+ Handling Form Submission: Handle the form submission in the view function or class, validate the form, and process the data if it is valid.

+ Displaying Validation Errors: Display error messages next to the corresponding form fields if the form is invalid.

+ Redisplaying the Form with Data: Re-render the form with the user's input in case of validation errors, allowing them to correct the input without re-entering everything.

### Q2. Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.

+ Django Templates in web development serve the purpose of generating dynamic HTML pages by separating presentation logic from business logic. They enable the creation of reusable HTML templates by allowing placeholders for dynamic data. Template inheritance is a powerful feature that promotes code reusability and maintainability. It involves creating a base template with common structure and layout, which can be extended by child templates. Child templates can override specific content blocks while inheriting the rest of the base template, allowing for customization and modularization. Template inheritance improves code organization, facilitates easier management of complex web applications, and ensures consistent presentation across the application.

### Q3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.

+ Django Views handle HTTP requests and responses. Function-based views are simpler and provide more flexibility but require manual implementation of features. Class-based views offer code organization, reusability, and built-in features, but can be more complex to understand. The choice depends on the project's requirements and complexity: function-based views are suitable for simple cases, while class-based views are preferable for more advanced functionality.
