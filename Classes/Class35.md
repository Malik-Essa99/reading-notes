### Graphs

A graph is a fundamental data structure in computer science and mathematics that consists of a collection of nodes (vertices) and connections between these nodes (edges). Graphs are widely used to model relationships and connections between entities. They are essential in various fields, including computer science, social networks, transportation systems, and more.

Graphs can be categorized into two main types:

1. Directed Graph (Digraph): In a directed graph, the edges have a direction, meaning they go from one vertex to another. This direction implies a one-way relationship between the vertices.

2. Undirected Graph: In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction, and the relationship between vertices is mutual or bidirectional.

Each vertex in a graph can be connected to one or more other vertices through edges. These connections can represent various relationships, such as friendship in a social network, roads between cities, dependencies between tasks

Vertices and Edges:

+ Vertices (Nodes): These are the fundamental units that represent entities or objects. Each vertex typically has a label or value that distinguishes it from other vertices.

+ Edges: These are the connections between vertices. An edge represents a relationship, interaction, or connection between the vertices it connects. Edges can be directed or undirected, and they can sometimes carry additional information, such as a weight.

Graphs can be used to model various real-world situations:

+ Social Networks
+ Maps and Routes
+ Computer Networks
+ Dependency Management
+ Recommendation Systems
