# Why this topic matters ?

As we continue in this course of Python, we are going to learn more about data analysis how it works. there are a lot of details to pay attention to and time to spend learning new things and practice.

# Questions

## In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

+ The main challenge is the all the new features and built-in methods in python in addition to the syntax. to overcome these osbtacles, I believe practice is the best way.

## After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

+ Time complexity: is how long an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input grows bigger.
+ Space complexity: is how much memory an algorithm uses as the size of the input grows bigger.

## Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

### The difference between Mutable & Immutable data types:

+ Mutable data types: data types that can be changed after they are created.for example (lists, sets , and dictionaries) When we modify a Mutable data type, we modify the actual items value.

+ Immutable data types: data types that can't be changed after they are created. for examples  (strings, floats, integers, and tuples)
 when we modify an Immutable data type, we don't actually change it's value, we basically create a new one and set its value to the desired one.
